The relevant sections for this information include discussions on financial performance, shareholder information, and corporate governance, particularly sections titled 'Dividend policy' and 'Distribution of retained earnings.' 3. On page 67, the report outlines the company's dividend policy, including a target payout ratio and intentions for returning profits to shareholders. 4. To determine if changes were made, we look for explicit statements mentioning updates or revisions to the policy. 5. A review of the entire report is necessary to catch any indirect references to policy changes. 6. After this review, no explicit mention of changes to the dividend policy is found. The report discusses the current policy but does not indicate any revisions."

To answer this, I reviewed the context provided for references to legal matters, especially the section on Legal Proceedings. 3. On page 37, the report clearly states, 'We have no material legal proceedings pending, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, and we do not know of any material proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities.' This sentence confirms that while there is mention of litigation, it is limited to routine matters that are not considered material. 4. It also indicates that there are no significant regulatory inquiries or material legal actions underway by stating that no material proceedings are pending or expected. 5. Thus, even though there is a mention of litigation, it is only ordinary and routine, and there are no significant regulatory inquiries or material litigation issues. 6. Therefore, there is indeed a reference to ongoing litigation, albeit routine in nature, which answers the question. 7. Based on the wording of the question, the answer should be True since routine litigation is mentioned, even if it is not material."

We need to examine these pages to find information related to the number of employees let go. 3. **Metric Matching:** Upon reviewing the provided pages, we find relevant information on page 91, which discusses the 'Summary of 2022 business position' and mentions the reduction of full-time positions.

The '294,000 colleagues' figure appears to be an overall employment number and does not isolate healthcare professionals exclusively; similarly, the 45,000 physicians are only a subset of healthcare professionals. 5.

This requires examining the annual report for any statements regarding changes in dividend policy. 2. The provided text includes various sections of the annual report. However, the key information regarding dividend policy changes would likely be found in sections discussing financial performance, shareholder information, or management's discussion. 3. The sections that could potentially discuss dividend policy include the Message from the President & CEO, the section on Liquidity and Capital Resources, and the Shareholder and Investor Information section. 4. On page 7, a '10% increase in our dividend' is mentioned, suggesting a change in the dividend amount but not necessarily the policy. 5. Page 20 discusses financial results, including a dividend per share increase from $0.52 to $0.60, indicating an increase in the dividend amount but not explicitly stating a policy change. 6. The dividend policy refers to guidelines governing dividend distribution decisions, and without explicit statements about altering these guidelines, it cannot be concluded that the policy has changed."

The most relevant sections for this question are those that discuss changes in leadership or management, such as the 'Group Management' section on page 78 and the descriptions of the Board of Directors and employee representatives on pages 81 and 82. 3. On page 78, it's mentioned that 'During the year, Group Management, including the CEO, consisted of nine persons.' It also notes that 'In September, the management team underwent a slight reorganization' which included changes such as Manfred Haagarten becoming temporary EVP for all of Commercial, and later this role being made permanent in November. Nicklas Bengtsson became EVP of the BioPak business area, and Mats Lindroth took on a new role as Senior Advisor. 4. The question asks for changes during the reporting period. The changes mentioned on page 78, such as the reorganization in September and the subsequent adjustments, fall within this timeframe. 5. The positions that changed during the reporting period are: - EVP Commercial - EVP of the BioPak business area - Senior Advisor (from a previous executive role) - EVP Strategic Development, IT and Communication (announced departure, implying a future change but not explicitly stated as occurring within the reporting period). 6. Given the information and focusing on the titles of positions that changed, we can list the positions. However, it's crucial to note that the question asks for positions, not names, and we should only include positions that were explicitly mentioned as changing during the reporting period. 7. Based on the analysis, the positions that changed during the reporting period are: - EVP Commercial - EVP of the BioPak business area - Senior Advisor"

To answer the question, we need to identify if there are any mentions of mergers or acquisitions within the provided context. 4. We should look for key terms like 'mergers,' 'acquisitions,' or any related phrases that might indicate such activities. 5. Upon examining the text, we find mentions of acquisitions in the context. For example, on page 9, it mentions 'Acquisition of Miers Construction Products Limited,' indicating that SIG plc did indeed engage in an acquisition. Furthermore, on page 25, under 'Focused growth,' it talks about 'Acquisitions' as part of their strategy, mentioning 'Five margin accretive acquisitions' and the strategic acquisition of Miers in the UK and Thermodämm in Germany. 6. Given the mentions of acquisitions and the discussion around them as part of SIG plc's strategy and activities, it's clear that the company did mention mergers or acquisitions in their annual report. 7. Since the question asks for a boolean value (True or False) based on whether SIG plc mentioned any mergers or acquisitions, and we have found evidence of such mentions, the final answer should reflect the presence of this information."

      "reasoning_process": "1. The question asks if Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. mentioned any mergers or acquisitions in their annual report. To answer this, we need to analyze the provided text carefully. \n2. The analysis involves understanding the question, which is about whether there were any mergers or acquisitions mentioned, and then looking for relevant keywords like 'merger,' 'acquisition,' 'sale,' or 'purchase' in the text.\n3. We identify relevant sections in the annual report, including the table of contents, notes to consolidated financial statements, management's discussion and analysis, and exhibits, to find any mentions of mergers or acquisitions.\n4. Upon reviewing the pages, we find that page 66 mentions the sale of Aptevo BioTherapeutics LLC to Medexus in February 2020, which is a significant transaction but from the perspective of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. as the seller, not the buyer, and thus does not constitute a merger or acquisition by the company itself.\n5. The conclusion is that while there is a mention of a sale, which could be considered an acquisition from the buyer's perspective, there is no mention of Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. being involved in a merger or acquisition as the acquiring party during the period covered by the annual report."

The statement shows that for the year ended 30 June 2022, the ‘Cash inflow from operating activities’ is 6,535. 4. It is important to note that the report’s figures are presented in thousands, as confirmed by related sections on pages 55 and 51, where amounts are specified as ‘£'000’. 5. Therefore, the value 6,535 represents 6,535,000 GBP. 6. No calculations beyond the unit conversion (multiplying by 1,000) are required.
