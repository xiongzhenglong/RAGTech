    # --- 3. Understanding BM25 Retrieval ---
    # BM25 retrieval works as follows:
    #   1. Tokenize the Query: The input query string is broken down into individual
    #      words (tokens), often after lowercasing and basic cleaning.
    #   2. Score Documents (Chunks): The BM25 algorithm calculates a relevance score
    #      for each document (chunk) in the indexed corpus with respect to the
    #      tokenized query. This score is based on:
    #         - Term Frequency (TF): How often query terms appear in a document.
    #         - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): How rare or common the query terms
    #           are across the entire corpus of documents. Rare terms get higher weight.
    #         - Document Length: BM25 penalizes very long documents that might match
    #           terms by chance, and normalizes for document length.
    #   3. Retrieve Top-N Chunks: The documents are ranked by their BM25 scores,
    #      and the top N highest-scoring documents are returned as the most relevant results.
    # This method is effective for keyword-based searches.
