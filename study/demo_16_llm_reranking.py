# --- Purpose of this Demo ---
# This script demonstrates LLM-based reranking of search results.
# Initial retrieval methods (like vector search or BM25) provide a set of candidate
# documents. LLM-based reranking uses a more powerful Language Model to assess
# the relevance of these candidates to the query in a more nuanced way.
# The LLM typically assigns a relevance score, which can then be combined with
# the initial retrieval score to produce a final, refined ranking.
# This helps to improve the precision of the top results shown to the user or
# passed to a final answer generation step.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# An `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set in your .env file in the project root,
# as `LLMReranker` uses an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models) to perform the reranking.
