# --- Purpose of this Demo ---
# This script demonstrates how to use the `APIProcessor` class to request
# and receive structured JSON output from an OpenAI Language Model (LLM).
# By providing a Pydantic model as the desired `response_format`, the LLM
# is instructed (often via function calling or JSON mode) to generate output
# that conforms to the schema of that Pydantic model. `APIProcessor` then
# automatically parses this JSON output into a Python dictionary.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# An `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set in your .env file in the project root.
# Structured output capabilities may depend on the specific LLM model used
# (e.g., "gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4-turbo" support JSON mode well).

# --- 1. Define Pydantic Model for Structured Output ---
